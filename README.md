# tendermono

Welcome to tendermono, a monorepo for organizing and showcasing various learning projects and experiments.

## Overview

This monorepo serves as a centralized repository for different projects, each demonstrating various concepts, technologies, or experiments learned during the development process. By using a monorepo structure, we aim to maintain consistency across projects, share common dependencies, and provide a unified view of our learning journey.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
tendermono/
├── apps
├── labs/
├── package/
│   ├── ui/
│   └── infra/
```
- `apps/`: Contains individual project directories.
- `labs/`: experiments new tech stack
- `packages` : shared component, uitl, orm, etc
